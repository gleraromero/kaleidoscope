# Kaleidoscope
In every experimentation process we need to be able to quickly visualize the results in order to make progress faster.

## Description
The main features of Kaleidoscope are:
- Visualizing [Runner](https://github.com/gleraromero/runner) output files.
- Establishes output JSON standard formats called KD types. It includes support for several common types (see [KD Types](#kd-types)).
- Visualizing experiment results in a table where output attributes can be selected independently and a search box let you filter results in an easy way.
- Zooming in an experiment result on an instance to see more details and graphics about that specific execution.

## Getting Started
The following instructions will guide you through the steps to use Kaleidoscope to visualize your *Runner* output files.

## Prerequisites
- Google Chrome Browser [(more info)](https://chrome.google.com/).

## Visualizing your first output file
Next we show you the steps to visualize an example output file included in the repository [examples](examples) folder.
1. Open the _index.html_ file on a web browser.
1. Click on the Choose Files button and select the blb.json file on the examples directory. This file is an example output of a bidirectional labeling algorithm.
1. Select the experiment named _Exact_ in the Experiments section.
1. Now a row with the experiment will appear. Select some attributes to show in the table.
1. Click the *Refresh* button.
1. Now a table with the information requested is shown. Click on the + button on an instance row to see more details about that instance. The *Detail View* will show more information.
That's it. Now you can try to open all different example files to see the supported formats.

## Supported KD Types
- [Simplex (lp)](#lp): Execution log of a simplex LP solver.
- [Branch and Cut (bc)](#bc): Execution log of a branch and cut solver.
- [Column Generation (cg)](#cg): Execution log of a column generation algorithm.
- [Branch Cut and Price (bcp)](#bcp): Execution log of a Branch Cut and Price algorithm.
- [Monodirectional Labeling (mlb)](#mlb): Execution log of a Monodirectional Labeling algorithm.
- [Bidirectional Labeling (blb)](#blb): Execution log of a Bidirectional Labeling algorithm.
- [VRP Solution (vrp_solution)](#vrp_solution): Solution of a VRP problem.

## Input files
The experiment files format accepted is the one defined by the [Runner Framework](https://github.com/gleraromero/runner). It is a JSON file with the following attributes:
- date: date when the experiment was started.
- time: total time (secs) spent running the experiments from the experimentation file.
- experiment_file: name of the experiment file executed.
- outputs: JSON array of Object with the following attributes for each experiment execution on an instance
  - dataset_name: name of the dataset used.
  - instance_name: name of the instance used.
  - experiment_name: name of the experiment executed.
  - stderr: string of the STDERR log of the execution.
  - stdout: JSON object result from the STDOUT of the execution.
  - exit_code: the execution exit_code (0 means successful, -6 means **OUTOFMEMORY**).
Example:
```javascript
{
  "date": "10-05-2019",
  "experiment_file": "experiment_easy",
  "outputs": [
    { "experiment_name": "preprocessing", "dataset_name": "dataset1", "instance_name": "easy_instance", exit_code: 0, stderr: "PREPROCESSING\nRUNNING\nFINISHED", stdout:{"solution": {"kd_type": "vrp_solution", "routes":[{"path":[0, 1, 3, 5], "t0":0, "duration":500}], "value": 500}}},
    { "experiment_name": "preprocessing", "dataset_name": "dataset2", "instance_name": "hard_instance", exit_code: 6, stderr: "PREPROCESSING\nRUNNING", stdout:""}
  ]
}
```
### stdout attribute
The **stdout** of each execution may contain several keys and values. We parse a value if it has the __"kd_type"__ attribute set. Depending on the value of that attribute we select the corresponding parser.

> Note: Not all attributes need to be present. The ones that exist will be parsed.

Following, we enumerate the supported types and their format:
## KD Types
### lp

## Adding a new parser
- Copy the `js/parsers/example_parser.js` file into `js/parsers/<name>_parser.js`
- Modify the name of the class
- Modify the end line `kd.add_parser("<your_kd_type>", new YourParserClass());`
- Modify the file `index.html` at the root directory and add at the end of the file:
  - `<script type="text/javascript" src="js/parsers/<name>_parser.js"></script>`
